# listFormulas
A Google Scripts App that searches the current Google Sheet and displays all the formulas in a custom dialog box. The formulas are listed in one of four groups:

1. QUERY
2. ARRAYFORMULA
3. SEQUENCE
4. Everything else

You can click on the group headings to show/hide the group formulas, and click on any row to activate the cell containing that formula.

This can be useful when the sheet contains formulas that result in arrays, especially if those formulas are located in a busy sheet.
